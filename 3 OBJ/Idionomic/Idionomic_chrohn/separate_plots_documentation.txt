ðŸ“‹ ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
===================

BOUNDARY DETECTION RESULTS:
   â€¢ Total boundary points: 132 (34.1% of all patients)
   â€¢ Boundary nodes: 2 GSOM nodes contain boundary cases
   â€¢ Region entropy: 0.32 (moderate genetic diversity)
   â€¢ Method used: Fixed threshold (0.3)

KEY GENETIC INSIGHTS:
   â€¢ No_Crohns cluster: 73.3% separability (some genetic overlap)
   â€¢ Crohns cluster: 60.4% separability (significant genetic mixing)
   â€¢ 36 mixed nodes where genetic patterns overlap
   â€¢ Average genetic region purity: 80.7%

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   â€¢ 132 patients show ambiguous genetic patterns
   â€¢ These cases require additional clinical evaluation
   â€¢ Genetic markers alone insufficient for definitive diagnosis
   â€¢ GSOM reveals underlying genetic structure and relationships
