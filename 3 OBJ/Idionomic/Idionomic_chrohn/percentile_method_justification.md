### Why Percentile Method Excels:

1. **Conservative by Design**: 25th percentile captures only the most confident cases
2. **GSOM-Aware**: Based on actual learned genetic structure
3. **Clinically Relevant**: High specificity reduces false positive diagnoses
4. **Scalable**: Works regardless of dataset size or complexity

## üßÆ Mathematical Foundation

### Percentile Calculation:

```
node_distances = pairwise_distances(trained_nodes, metric='euclidean')
upper_triangle = remove_diagonal(node_distances)
threshold = 25th_percentile(upper_triangle)
```

### Clinical Interpretation:

- **Threshold 2.9671**: Genetic distance below which patients are considered boundary cases
- **25th Percentile**: Only 25% of node pairs are closer than this threshold
