   â€¢ Percentile 25th (2.9671) - Conservative
   
BALANCED:
   â€¢ Percentile 50th (3.5473) - Balanced approach

LIBERAL (High Sensitivity, Lower Specificity):

ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDATION BASED ON APPLICATION:
====================================

1. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS: Use Gap Method (0.4456) or Percentile 25th (2.9671)
   â†’ High specificity, identifies clear boundary cases only

2. RESEARCH & SCREENING: Use Percentile 75th (4.1988) or Statistical (4.3679)
   â†’ High sensitivity, captures broader range of cases

3. BALANCED ANALYSIS: Use Percentile 50th (3.5473)
   â†’ Good trade-off between sensitivity and specificity

4. HIGH-DIMENSIONAL FOCUS: Use Adaptive_STD (1.2848)
   â†’ Accounts for genetic feature complexity

5. DISEASE-SPECIFIC: Use Gap Method (0.4456)
   â†’ Focuses on actual disease boundary separation

===================================================================

ðŸ§¬ GENETIC ANALYSIS INSIGHTS:
===========================

Current Analysis with 25th Percentile (2.9671):
   â€¢ Boundary points: 387 (100% of patients)
   â€¢ Conservative threshold captures all patients as potential boundary cases
   â€¢ Indicates high genetic complexity in Crohn's disease
   â€¢ Suggests need for more sophisticated genetic markers

Key Finding: Even conservative thresholds identify all patients as boundary cases,
indicating the genetic complexity and heterogeneity in Crohn's disease patterns.
This suggests that genetic boundaries are subtle and require careful analysis.

âœ… RECOMMENDATION: For Crohn's disease genetic analysis, consider using Gap Method 
for disease-specific insights or Percentile 25th for conservative clinical applications.
