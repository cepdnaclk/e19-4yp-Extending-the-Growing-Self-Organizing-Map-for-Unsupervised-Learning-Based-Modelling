- **4.1988 - 7.7125**: Low confidence cases (25%)

## 🏆 Optimal Application Strategy

### For Clinical Diagnosis (Use 25th Percentile):

```python
distance_threshold = 'percentile'  # Will use 25th percentile (2.9671)
# High specificity, clinical confidence
```

### For Research & Screening (Use 75th Percentile):

```python
distance_threshold = 'percentile'  # Modified to use 75th percentile (4.1988)
# High sensitivity, comprehensive detection
```

### For Balanced Approach (Use 50th Percentile):

```python
distance_threshold = 'percentile'  # Configure for 50th percentile (3.5473)
# Balanced sensitivity/specificity
```
