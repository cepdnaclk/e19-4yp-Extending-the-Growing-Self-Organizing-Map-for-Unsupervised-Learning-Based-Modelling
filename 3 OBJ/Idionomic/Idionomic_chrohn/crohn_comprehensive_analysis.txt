üåç 3. REGIONS vs CLUSTERS ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
Regions are spatial neighborhoods; clusters are similarity groups

üìà Region Summary:
  ‚Ä¢ Pure regions (>90% purity): 84
  ‚Ä¢ Mixed regions: 95
  ‚Ä¢ Average region purity: 80.75%

üåà Most Diverse Regions (Province-like):
  Region 0: 2 classes, entropy=1.00, purity=50.00%
    Distribution: {'Crohns': np.int64(5), 'No_Crohns': np.int64(5)}
  Region 6: 2 classes, entropy=1.00, purity=50.00%
    Distribution: {'Crohns': np.int64(4), 'No_Crohns': np.int64(4)}
  Region 265: 2 classes, entropy=1.00, purity=50.00%
    Distribution: {'No_Crohns': np.int64(1), 'Crohns': np.int64(1)}


üéØ 4. QUANTIZATION DIFFERENCE ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
How well do node weights represent actual data points?

üìä Overall quantization error: 2.7306

üèÜ Most representative nodes:
  Node 981: error=1.2833, samples=4
  Node 960: error=1.3424, samples=3
  Node 834: error=1.4176, samples=2

Understanding the structural relationships in data

üå≥ Structure Summary:
  ‚Ä¢ Total paths: 484
  ‚Ä¢ Branching points: 2668
  ‚Ä¢ Endpoints: 98
  ‚Ä¢ Average path length: 20.1

üîó Key Structural Nodes:
  ‚Ä¢ Junction nodes (branch points): []
  ‚Ä¢ Endpoint nodes (boundaries): [20, 38, 85, 87, 138, 142, 146, 159, 171, 173, 196, 321, 337, 346, 350, 366, 380, 400, 428, 457, 477, 493, 526, 533, 536, 541, 592, 593, 647, 655, 665, 673, 734, 751, 755, 773, 779, 789, 802, 806, 813, 824, 832, 853, 870, 871, 889, 890, 922, 923, 924, 926, 935, 940, 943, 944, 947, 949, 960, 963, 965, 967, 972, 979, 980, 982, 984, 989, 992, 994, 997, 1000, 1004, 1006, 1011, 1017, 1018, 1024, 1025, 1026, 1027, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1033, 1036, 1038, 1039, 1042, 1044, 1048, 1049, 1050, 1052, 1054, 1055, 1058, 1059]


üìå 6. KEY INSIGHTS & INTERPRETATIONS
----------------------------------------
üîÑ Versicolor-Virginica confusion: 0 mixed nodes
   ‚Üí These classes are NOT linearly separable in the given feature space
üåç Average region diversity (entropy): 0.49
   ‚Üí Higher entropy = more mixed regions (like diverse provinces)
üéØ Well-represented nodes: 0/190 (0.0%)
   ‚Üí Node weights closely reflect actual data positioning

üí° CONCLUSION: GSOM reveals the underlying structure beyond simple classification.
   The spatial organization shows WHY and WHERE confusion occurs, not just THAT it occurs.
