üìå 6. KEY INSIGHTS & INTERPRETATIONS
----------------------------------------
‚úÖ Most separable class: 0 (70.2% pure separation)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Most mixed class: 0 (42 mixed nodes)
üåç Average region diversity (entropy): 0.44
   ‚Üí Higher entropy = more mixed regions (like diverse provinces)
üéØ Well-represented nodes: 0/203 (0.0%)
   ‚Üí Node weights closely reflect actual data positioning

üí° CONCLUSION: GSOM reveals the underlying structure beyond simple classification.
   The spatial organization shows WHY and WHERE confusion occurs, not just THAT it occurs.
